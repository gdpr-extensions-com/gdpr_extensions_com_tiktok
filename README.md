# GDPR-Extensions-com - TikTok 2xClick Solution

Add TikTok videos to your website and stay GDPR compliant! Your website viewers will be able to manage their cookie preferences and view the content only if consented.

Stay GDPR compliant when your website is scanned by any Cookie or GDPR Scanner!

## Overview

**GDPR-Extensions-com - TikTok 2xClick Solution** allows you to add content elements and as many TikTok videos as you want on your website without being flagged on cookie scanners!

This extension works in parallel with our GDPR-Extensions.com Consent Manager, where your website viewer can update their cookie preferences any time!

## Without GDPR-Extensions.com Consent Manager

- The TikTok cookie will not be created, and the user will not be able to view the video until they consent to the content mask that you style and hides the video.
- Once the user has consented, they are able to view the TikTok video, the cookie is created, and the default session duration is 30 days.
- The user will not be able to update their cookie preferences, and their data will be saved until the session has expired.

## With GDPR-Extensions.com Consent Manager

- The GDPR-Extensions-com Consent Manager Typo3 extension is powered by the gdpr-extensions.com dashboard.
- It scans your website and auto-detects cookies and external sources.
- It provides you with a content element “Consent Manager” that you can add to your website where all cookies are listed and users can manage the TikTok 2xClick cookie any time.
- Website viewers will be able to view the Consent Manager anytime by clicking on the cookie widget which you can always customize its styling, language content, and position.
